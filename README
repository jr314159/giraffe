The Giraffe Project
Joel Rosen
Winter Term Project 03-04

This is a demo of my game engine.

The music is from Megaman 2 by Capcom.  The sounds and artwork are original.

Required libraries:
SDL
SDL_image
SDL_mixer
SDL_gfx

To compile and run:
% ./configure
% make
% cp src/giraffe .
% ./giraffe

(If for some reason it complains that it can't find the data files,
edit the DATA_PREFIX definition in src/file.h)

Controls:
z = shoot, run
x = jump
arrow keys = go left, right

f4 = switch fullscreen mode
esc = quit

For a full technical explanation of the game, see doc/giraffe.txt
